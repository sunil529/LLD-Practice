Low-Level Design Question: Payment System
Problem Statement:
Design a Payment System that allows users to make transactions securely through different payment methods like Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI, Wallets, and Net Banking. The system should handle fraud detection, refunds, transaction history, and failure handling efficiently.

Functional Requirements:
User Authentication & Authorization

Users must log in using secure credentials.

Role-based access (Admin, User, Merchant).

Payment Processing

Support multiple payment methods (Credit/Debit Cards, UPI, Wallets, Net Banking).

Secure payment gateway integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay).

Handle one-time payments and recurring payments (subscriptions).

Transaction Management

Track transactions with unique transaction IDs.

Status tracking (Pending, Completed, Failed, Refunded).

Store payment details securely.

Refund & Chargeback Handling

Partial and full refunds.

Chargeback management if the user disputes a transaction.

Failure Handling & Retry Mechanism

Automatic retries for failed transactions.

Notify users about failures with reasons.

Fraud Detection & Risk Assessment

Detect fraudulent transactions using rule-based or ML models.

Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for high-risk transactions.

Notification & Alerts

Notify users via SMS, Email, or Push Notifications about transaction status.

Inform merchants about successful transactions.

Transaction History & Reporting

Users and merchants should be able to view past transactions and generate reports.

Multi-Currency Support

Allow international transactions with currency conversion.

Payment Limits & Rate Limiting

Set transaction limits per user/day.

Prevent excessive API calls to avoid abuse.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability

The system should handle millions of transactions per second.

Security & Compliance

PCI-DSS compliance for handling card payments securely.

Use encryption (AES, RSA) for sensitive payment data.

Implement tokenization to replace card details with unique tokens.

High Availability & Reliability

Ensure 99.99% uptime with load balancing and failover mechanisms.

Use replicated databases and caching for fast responses.

Low Latency

Payment processing should complete within 1-3 seconds.

Logging & Auditing

Maintain detailed logs for debugging and compliance.

Store logs for at least 6 months for regulatory purposes.

Extensibility

Easy integration with new payment gateways in the future.

Concurrency & Performance Optimization

Handle thousands of concurrent transactions efficiently.

Follow-up Questions:
How would you design the database schema for storing payments and transactions?

How would you ensure transaction idempotency to avoid duplicate payments?

Which design patterns would you use in this system (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Strategy)?

How would you handle international payments and currency conversions?

How would you implement a risk engine for fraud detection?

How will you ensure fast response times even during peak loads?

What caching mechanisms would you implement to optimize performance?
