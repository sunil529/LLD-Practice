Problem Statement:
Design a scalable and efficient Notification System that can be used by e-commerce platforms like Amazon or 
Flipkart to send notifications to users. The system should support multiple notification 
channels (Email, SMS, Push Notifications, Webhooks, etc.) and allow users to configure their notification preferences.

Functional Requirements:
Support multiple notification channels: Email, SMS, Push notifications, Webhooks, etc.

User Preferences: Users can enable/disable notifications for different channels.

Notification Types:

Order Confirmation

Delivery Updates

Promotional Offers

Account Security Alerts

Batch Processing: Ability to send notifications in bulk.

Retry Mechanism: If a notification fails, the system should retry after a delay.

Priority Handling: Some notifications (e.g., security alerts) must be sent immediately.

Asynchronous Processing: Decouple notification generation from actual sending.

Logging & Auditing: Store logs of sent notifications for debugging and analytics.

Third-Party Integration: Support third-party notification services like Twilio, Firebase, and SES.

Rate Limiting: Prevent spamming users with too many notifications.

Template Management: Store and manage different notification templates.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability: Should handle millions of notifications per day.

Fault Tolerance: If one channel (e.g., SMS) fails, others should still work.

High Availability: The system should be available 24/7.

Performance: Notifications should be processed within seconds.

Security: Ensure that notifications (especially account-related ones) are secure.

Extensibility: Ability to add new notification channels in the future.

Consistency: Notifications should not be lost due to system failures.

Follow-Up Questions (Interview Scenarios)
Q)How will you ensure real-time notifications for urgent messages?

To ensure real-time notifications for urgent messages:

Priority Queue: Maintain a priority queue where urgent messages (like security alerts) are processed first.

WebSockets: Use WebSockets for instant push notifications in real-time applications.

Kafka / RabbitMQ: Implement message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for event-driven real-time processing.

Push Notification Services: Leverage third-party services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs).

Retries with Exponential Backoff: Immediate retries if an urgent notification fails.

Q)How would you implement a retry mechanism for failed notifications?
To handle failed notifications, implement:

Retry with Exponential Backoff: If a notification fails, retry after an increasing delay (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, etc.).

Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): Store failed notifications and reprocess them later.

Logging & Alerting: Log failures and send alerts for manual intervention if needed.

Q)How can you scale the system to support billions of notifications?
o scale to billions of notifications:

Distributed Architecture: Use Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS for message queues.

Microservices-Based Design: Break the system into independent services (e.g., Email Service, SMS Service).

Database Optimization: Use NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra) for storing notifications efficiently.

Load Balancing: Distribute load using Kubernetes, Nginx, or AWS Load Balancer.

Caching: Store user preferences and templates in Redis to reduce database load.

Q)How will you manage user notification preferences efficiently?
Users may want to receive only specific types of notifications.

Strategies:

Database Storage: Store preferences in a UserPreferences table.

Cache Preferences: Use Redis to avoid repeated database queries.

Filter Before Sending: Check user preferences before sending a notification.

Q)Which design patterns would you use in this system? (Observer, Factory, etc.)
Observer Pattern: Already used to notify multiple subscribers.

Factory Pattern: To create different notification senders dynamically.

Singleton Pattern: To manage NotificationManager as a single instance.

Strategy Pattern: To switch between different notification strategies dynamically.

Adapter Pattern: To integrate third-party services like Twilio, Firebase, etc.

Q)How would you ensure notifications are not sent multiple times due to failures?
To prevent duplicate notifications:

Idempotency: Assign a unique Notification ID and check if it was already processed.

Distributed Locks: Use Redis locks to prevent concurrent processing.

Database Transactions: Store notifications in a status table and update only once.

Deduplication in Kafka: Use Kafka exactly-once processing.

Q)How will you integrate third-party notification services?
To send notifications via third-party services like Twilio, Firebase, or AWS SNS:

Use an Adapter Pattern: Create an adapter for each provider.

API Abstraction: Implement an interface for all providers.

Failover Mechanism: If one service fails, fallback to another.
