The Fixed Window Counter algorithm limits the number of requests a user/client can make within a fixed time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute). Once the counter exceeds the limit, all further requests in that window are rejected.

"The Fixed Window Counter algorithm limits the number of allowed requests in a fixed interval (e.g., 5 requests per 10 seconds). I implemented it to throttle API calls per client to avoid server overload. The logic is simple: reset the counter after the window elapses and deny requests once the limit is hit."

📦 Key Concepts

Term	Description
Window Size	Duration of the time window (e.g., 1 minute)
Limit	Max allowed requests per window
Counter	Number of requests seen in the current window
Reset Time	Time when the window resets
✅ Use Case
Prevent brute-force login attempts

API rate limiting (e.g., 60 requests/minute)

Easy to implement and understand

🧠 Pros and Cons
✅ Pros:
Easy to implement

Efficient in low-volume scenarios

❌ Cons:
Traffic spikes at the edges (beginning of each window)

All users can hit the limit again right after reset
